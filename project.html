			<h1>Project Overview </h1>
			<p class="">Color is innate in food perception and consumers expect vivid colors -- beyond those already present in food. Due to backlash against artificial colorants, some large food companies have pledged to exclusively use natural food colorings, which may result in the disappearance of some brightly colored food (1). This is a complex transition as there are limited natural options for food pigment and the regulatory framework is evolving. In this project we demonstrate that cyanobacteriochrome (CBCR) proteins are a viable natural alternative to artificial food dyes.</p>

			<h3>Motivation</h3> 
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Color is a powerful visual cue, and we rely on our color perception-- especially when it comes to food. (data about color)This is just one of many examples of how changing the color of the food makes a difference on how recognizable and appetizing a product is. As the saying goes; “we eat with our eyes” . Food companies recognize this and spend time and money researching the color of their products. For a range of products, companies can purchase specific colorimeters which measure the color of the foods according to USDA standards (2). </p>
			<p>   
        	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, color is important in food perception. However, with the current push against synthetic food dyes, some of the bright colors our society expects may soon start to disappear. This mounting pressure to rid food of synthetic dyes largely is due to consumer pressure after some studies suggested adverse human health effects. Recently, large corporations such as Mars, Kraft, General Mills, and Nestle USA have promised to use exclusively natural food coloring within the next 5 years (3,4,5,6). Even MARS states that “this is going to be a complex task and they will need to work to find new ingredients and formulas” (3).</p>
        	<p>
        	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there is this large market pressure, we are also responding to a greater environmental and social need for improved natural food coloring. Not only are synthetic dyes being rejected by natural food advocates, frequently their “all natural” alternatives introduce environmental concerns. Many natural alternatives come from crops, like turmeric or carrots. Unfortunately, this requires arable land and takes up valuable acreage that could be used to feed the quickly growing human population (7). Using thousands of hectares of land just to add color to our foods is arguably irresponsible.</p><p>
        	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ideally we need a food colorant which can be mass produced without requiring arable land, has color properties similar to synthetic dyes, and has a wide pH and temperature stability range.</p>
        	<h3>Solution</h3>
			<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our solution is gearing a highly versatile protein pigment from cyanobacteria to become the new alternative to synthetic dyes. </p><p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To narrow in on a specific goal this summer, we focused on finding a replacement to Blue #1 however, future directions of our project will apply to all major colors. Blue #1, or Brilliant Blue, is made from the aromatic hydrocarbons from petroleum which peaks at 630nm (8). One promising alternative is Spirulina which was approved by the FDA (9). Spirulina color is from the dried biomass of the cyanobacteria Spirulina platensis and It was a promising source of blue color (10) ; however, its lack of color vibrancy, temperature, and pH range is limiting its use (cite ). Other blue natural alternatives like blueberries or red cabbage are insufficient as well as the color is dependent on pH (11). Industry is still seeking a way to sufficiently switch from blue synthetic dyes, to those considered natural. </p><p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We approached this project by thinking about four large technical considerations: gene selection, protein properties, production optimization, and expression in GRAS organism. However, the technical work is only a small part in the larger aim of our project to bring together science, industry regulation, and consumer acceptance.</p>
