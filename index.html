      <h2>Our Project</h2>
      <p>Color is innate in food perception and consumers expect vivid colors -- beyond those already present in food. Due to backlash against artificial colorants, some large food companies have pledged to exclusively use natural food colorings, which may result in the disappearance of some brightly colored food (1). This is a complex transition as there are limited natural options for food pigment and the regulatory framework is evolving. In this project we show that cyanobacteriochrome (CBCR) proteins are a viable and natural alternative to artificial food dyes.</p><br>

			<h3>Samir Akre</h3>
			<p>I'm an incoming 3rd year at UC Davis studying Biomedical Engineering with a hopeful minor in Quantitative Biology and Bioinformatics. I currently do research at the Passerini lab studying atherosclerosis and the Mills lab studying infant gut microbiology. I'm a brother of the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity (TKE), Tau Beta Pi engineering honors society (TBP), and the Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES). I play the guitar, have a black belt in Tae Kwon Do, love making artisan coffee, used to be on a competitive dance team!</p>

			<h3>Amanda Everitt</h3>
			<p>I’m a senior at UC Davis majoring in Biotechnology-Bioinformatics. I’m particularly interested in improving computational aspects of metagenome studies. Currently, I work in Jonathan Eisen’s Lab handling and refining microbiome data and the Vector Genetics Lab studying malaria transmitting Anopheles mosquitoes. When I’m not consumed in my computer, I focus my time on cooking and watching crummy 80s movies.</p>

			<h3>Jonathan Chen</h3>
			<p>I recently graduated with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering, with a double emphasis in cell/tissue engineering and medical devices. I’ve worked in the TEAM MPBIL for the past year conducting research on characterizing synthetic oscillator designs in E. coli. I’m a member of three different national honors societies: Tau Beta Pi, Phi Kappa Phi, and the National Society of Leadership and Success, as well as the Biomedical Engineering Society. My post-grad goal is to make an impact in biotechnology, while still treating learning as a lifelong endeavor. I spend most of my free time on Netflix, watching anime, reading good books, writing novels, and occasionally working out (not all at once though).</p>

			<h3>Alexis Caligiuri</h3>
			<p>I am am a recent graduate from UC Davis with a B.A. in Science and Technology Studies and a first year law student at UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall. I completed my thesis for highest honors on interactions between speculative fiction and national security, and presented it at the ICFA conference in Florida last Spring. I was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa, and I served as the Chief Justice for the ASUCD Court in 2015. When I'm not critically investigating the relationships between science and society, I enjoy exploring cheeses from around the world, hula hooping, and watching (and rewatching) Star Trek. </p>

			<h3>Brent Weyers</h3>
			<p>I am a 5th year undergraduate student in Biomedical Engineering, graduating with my Bachelor of Science degree at the end of Fall Quarter 2016. I currently perform UG research with Dr. Tingrui Pan's Lab Group on microfluidics and quantitative biological assessments, I am on the UC Davis iGEM team, and I am working on a start-up company attempting to carry my senior capstone project forward beyond academica. I thoroughly enjoy research and I am applying for Ph.D. programs this Fall in Biomedical Engineering. In my free time, I enjoy running (both competitively and non-competitively) and triathalon activities. </p>
