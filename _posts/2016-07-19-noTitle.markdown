Seven colonies grew on plate from 7/18. Need to colony PCR to confirm success. We are skeptical of success and believe it is ultimately a failure. 

Amplified RBS (ab), RBS (cd), and RBS (kl)
Preformed gel electrophoresis on Bacillus amplification from 7/13 and todayâ€™s amplifications. Npf and B0015 appear to be correct (___bp) ; however, the RBS fall below ladder minimum at 16bp so the successfulness cannot be determined.
