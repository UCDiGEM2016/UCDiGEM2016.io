Goal: Purify the CBCR protein from cells
<ol>
<li>Expression
<ol>
<li>37degC &rarr; Shake 2-6 hours</li>
<li>24degC &rarr; Shake 12 - 25 hours</li>
<li>18degC &rarr; 16 - 36 hours</li>
<li>Transfer cells to 50mL Falcon and spin for 20-40min at max speed</li>
<li>Decant supernatent and store cells in -20</li>
<li>Initiate cultures in 50mL TB + Antibiotic (i.e. rich and buffered media) using an inoculum from an overnight or a fresh colony and shake at 37degC</li>
<li>Measure OD every 0.5-2 hours (i.e. take 100uL and add to 1mL) until OD reaches 1 (for blue&hellip; maybe higher for red?) in the culture (so would read 0.1 in instrument since there was a 10x dilution).</li>
<li>Add inducing agent and shake at defined temperature</li>
<li>Harvest cells</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Lysis
<ol>
<li>Vortexing is fine, once resuspended keep on ice</li>
<li>Save 10uL for gel analysis!</li>
<li>Sonicate the cell suspension with 10 short burst of 10 sec followed by intervals of 30 sec for cooling. Keep the suspension at all times in water-ice bath. (Avoid foaming)</li>
<li>Remove cell debris by ultracentrifugation at 4&deg;C for 30 min at 45 000 rpm using a 45Ti rotor</li>
<li>Transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube-- this is your crude protein extract</li>
<li>Save 10uL for gel analysis before next step</li>
<li>Resuspend cells in 0.5mL of lysis buffer</li>
<li>Sonication</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Purification
<ol>
<li>For every 1mL of culture, add 200uL of bead slurry (ie 20mL for every 1L culture) ~ for example 50mL culture = 1mL bead slurry</li>
<li>In a fresh 2mL tube aliquot bead slurry of chitin binding resin</li>
<li>Spin down at 1000rpm for 1min and pippette off ethanol supernatent</li>
<li>Resuspend in wash buffer</li>
<li>Spin down at 1000rpm for 1min and pippette off supernatent</li>
<li>Add Supernatent from lysis</li>
<li>Incubate on rocker in cold room for 2 hours</li>
<li>Spin down at 1000rpm for 1min and pippette off supernatent</li>
<li>Save supernatent as this is your flow through and will want to analyze on a gel</li>
<li>Resuspend in 1mL wash buffer</li>
<li>Transfer to a 50mL Falcon tube with 10mL of wash buffer</li>
<li>Incubate on rocker in cold room for 0.5 hours</li>
<li>Spin down at 1000rpm for 5min and decant/pippette off supernatent</li>
<li>Add 10mL of wash buffer</li>
<li>Incubate on rocker in cold room for 0.5 hours</li>
<li>Spin down at 1000rpm for 5min and decant/pippette off supernatent</li>
<li>Add 1mL of cleavege buffer</li>
<li>Transfer to 2mL tube &amp; incubate overnight (16-24 hours) at room temperature (or potentially cold room&hellip; depends on stability of protein) on rocker</li>
<li>Spin down at 1000rpm for 1min</li>
<li>Transfer supernatent to fresh tube, this should be your protein!</li>
<li>Transfer Chitin resin to &ldquo;USED&rdquo; tube that is in 50% Ethanol at 4deg. Save until significant amount of material and then regenerate as described below.</li>
<li>Analyze Purified protein (Spectrum and SDS Protein Gels)</li>
<li>OPTIONAL: May need to concentrate and/or buffer exchange using a concentrator.</li>
<li>***GIVEN THE LOW BINDING CAPACITY OF THE COLUMN IT IS LIKELY YOU WILL NEED TO CONCENTRATE FOR WHAT WE ARE DOING*** Make sure to talk a lot of Wilson, Katie, Youtian in the Siegel group who do protein production and purification on an almost daily basis (show em this protocol as we generally use his beads with his tagged proteins which have a ~10x higher binding capacity).</li>
