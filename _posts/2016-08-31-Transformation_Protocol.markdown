1. Label 14 mL Falcon tubes and place them on ice.
2. Gently thaw tube of competent cells in the palm of the hand. Once the cells have thawed, IMMEDIATELY transfer the tube on ice.
3. Pipette 50 µL of competent cells into the bottom of each Falcon tube
4. While gently swirling to mix, add 7.5 µL of transforming DNA into the small pool of competent cells on the bottom of each correspondingly labeled tube.
5. Incubate the cells on ice for 15 mins.
6. Bring samples to the 42°C water bath. Heat shock for exactly 45 seconds.
7. Immediately place tubes back on ice for 1-2 mins.
8. Working sterilely, add 800 µL of LB to each tube.
9. Place your tubes into a 37°C incubator shaker for 45-60 mins.
10. Label your plates accordingly 
11. Plate 200 µL of your transformed cells on each corresponding plate.
	* Use glass beads to spread your cells evenly.
12. Place in static 37°C incubator for ~16 hours.
