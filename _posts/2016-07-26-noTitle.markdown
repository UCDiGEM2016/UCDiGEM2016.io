PCR amplified CBCR 9, 11, ocs, ga_2, ga_3, cyan, cha, and npf. All successful-- determined PCR cleanup for npf and gel extraction for the rest. 
(Insert gel)

Gel results from golden gate reaction on 7/25 hardly show any ligation products. We believe this is because the low DNA concentrations. We still transformed DHSalpha and plated to look for results tomorrow. 
Also, minipreped collaborators plasmids containing PCB+BV for Amanda
Also, sent false positive colony from (date) for sequencing.
