1. Make the Gel:
	1. 	Measure 0.5 g of agarose.
	2. 	Add 50 mL of 1X TAE (Tris Base, Acetic Acid, EDTA) Buffer.
	3. 	Microwave for ~1 minute or until agarose is melted.
	4. 	Cool to ~45°C, or warm to the touch.
	5. 	Add 3 μL of SYBR Safe gel stain (this is an intercalating dye that fluoresces when DNA is present) and mix well without producing bubbles.
	6. 	Pour melted agarose into a gel mold with a comb in place.
	7. 	Pop any lingering bubbles with a pipette tip.
	8. 	Cure agarose gel at room temperature.

2. Run the Gel:
	1. 	Stretch the piece of parafilm across one end of the 80-well tube rack. Make wells in the parafilm by pushing gently into the parafilm.
	2. 	Pipette out 1.5 μL of the 6X loading dye for each of your wells.
	3. 	Add 5 μL of your PCR reaction to each well and mix by gently pipetting up and down. (Make sure to keep track of which sample is which)
	4. 	Add 5 μL of each sample into the gel. Ensure that there is at least one lane with 5 μL of ladder/standard.
	5. 	Run the Gel at 120 V for 30 minutes.
