1. Mix 1 volume of sample to 2 volumes of Buffer NTI
2. Place a NucleoSpin® Gel and PCR Clean-up Column into a Collection Tube (2 mL) and load up to 700 μL sample
3. Centrifuge for 30 s at 11,000 x g. Discard flow-through and place the column back into the collection tube.
	* Load remaining sample if necessary and repeat the centrifugation step.
4. Add 700 μL Buffer NT3 to the NucleoSpin® Gel and PCR Clean-up Column. Centrifuge for 30 s at 11,000 x g. Discard flow-through and place the column back into the collection tube
5. Centrifuge for 1 min at 11,000 x g to remove Buffer NT3 completely. Make sure the spin column does not come in contact with the flow-through while removing it from the centrifuge and the collection tube.
6. Place the NucleoSpin® Gel and PCR Clean-up Column into a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube (not provided). Add 15–30 μL Buffer NE and incubate at room temperature (18–25 °C) for 1 min. Centrifuge for 1 min at 11,000 x g.
OR add 20 uL of water and centrifuge for 10 min
7. Dispose of the column, keep the flow-through.
