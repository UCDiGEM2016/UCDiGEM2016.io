Goal: clean bead of any previous protein so it can be used again
<ol>
<li>Take empty column and add10mL 0.3NaOH, 5 times at room temp.</li>
<li>Neutralize flow through NaOH with HCl</li>
<li>Allow to soak for 30 minutes</li>
<li>Repeat with 10mL water, 20 times</li>
<li>Repeat with 10mL wash buffer, 5 times</li>
<li>Continue to step 4 of above protocol</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Storing the purified protein: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>In the form straight from purification with 10% glycerol you need to freeze it using liquid nitrogen so that ice crystals don&rsquo;t form and break the protein</li>
<li>Otherwise, you need to make it â…” glycerol/ volume so that you can store it in a -20C</li>
</ol>
