1. Excise DNA fragment / solubilize gel slice 
    * Note: Minimize UV exposure time to avoid damaging the DNA. 
2. Take a clean scalpel to excise the DNA fragment from an agarose gel. Remove all excess agarose. Determine the weight of the gel slice and transfer it to a clean tube. For each 100 mg of agarose gel < 2 % add 200 μL Buffer NTI. For gels containing > 2 % agarose, double the volume of Buffer NTI. Incubate sample for 5–10 min at 50 °C. Vortex the sample briefly every 2–3 min until the gel slice is completely dissolved!

3. Place a NucleoSpin® Gel and PCR Clean-up Column into a Collection Tube (2 mL) and load up to 700 μL sample. Centrifuge for 30 s at 11,000 x g. Discard flow-through and place the column back into the collection tube. Load remaining sample if necessary and repeat the centrifugation step

4. Add 700 μL Buffer NT3 to the NucleoSpin® Gel and PCR Clean-up Column. Centrifuge for 30 s at 11,000 x g. Discard flow-through and place the column back into the collection tube. 
Dry silica membrane 
5. Centrifuge for 1 min at 11,000 x g to remove Buffer NT3 completely. Make sure the spin column does not come in contact with the flow-through while removing it from the centrifuge and the collection tube.

6. Place the NucleoSpin® Gel and PCR Clean-up Column into a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube (not provided). Add 15–30 μL Buffer NE and incubate at room temperature (18–25 °C) for 1 min. Centrifuge for 1 min at 11,000 x g
OR add 20 uL of water and centrifuge for 10 min
