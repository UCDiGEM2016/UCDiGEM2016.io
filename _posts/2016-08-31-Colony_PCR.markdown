1. Use a sharpie to mark 2 colonies that will screen the transformation plate. Label colonies with initials.
2. On replicate plate, mark 2 locations where you will put the replicate colonies. Label each spot in the same way as from the transformation plate.
3. Pipette 10 uL of sterile H2O into 2 PCR tubes
4. Use 10 uL pipette tip to pick up colony (gently touch side of tip to colony), gently touch marked location on replicate plate and put the tip into one of the PCR tubes
5. Repeat for the other colony
6. Calculate master mix for two PCR reactions
7. In 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, make master mix. Add TAQ last. Mix and spin down.
8. Attach one of the tips in the PCR tube to a 10 uL pipette. Slowly pipette up and down to empty out cells, and then discard tip.
9. Repeat for other tip.
10. Add 10 uL of master mix to each PCR tubes
11. Mix, spin down, and put in thermocycler.
