<p>Goal: Find dark state and photoproduct state absorbance</p>
<ol>
<li>Turn on, and allow spectrometer to warm up for ~15min</li>
<li>Calibrate spectrometer with control solution of 50ul dialysis buffer</li>
<li>Put 50ul purified protein into plate well (3 reps each protein)</li>
<li>Take an absorbance spectrum ( 250-750nm - maybe try to narrow for more exact measurement once we know where it is)</li>
<li>Take a laser pointer and shine light on sample for at least 1 minute or until the entire sample changes color</li>
<li>Measure absorbance again (x3)</li>
<li>Wait until color is back to dark state, shine light on it again until all changed, start timer, and record how long it takes to revert back to dark state for a ~rough~ dark reversion time.</li>
</ol>
