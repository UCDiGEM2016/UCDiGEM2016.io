Ensure reagents are thawed, mix well and spin down.
Add 10 ng of appropriate template to each PCR tube
Add 2.5 µL of correctly paired forward and reverse primers to each PCR tube
Add water then 5X buffer then dNTPs to each tube
Remove Phusion from freezer and add to each PCR tube. *Phusion is temperature sensitive: keep cool*. Mix well and spin down. 
Place tubes in PCR machine: use Phusion protocol in the BIM143L folder. 
Ensure that the extension time is correct for the size of the DNA fragment you are amplifying. Phusion polymerase has an extension rate of 1kb/30sec.
