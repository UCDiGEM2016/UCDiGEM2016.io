Prepared cell culture of collaborators cells so that we can mini prep them tomorrow. 

Third Golden Gate reaction performed on npf, pcyA, RBS1, RBS2, and the plasmid. Allowed to incubate overnight at 16â„ƒ. 
PCR amplified CBCR 3,4,6, and 8. All were successful and determined to PCR clean-up on CBCR 6 and 8 because they were cleaner bands  and perform a gel extraction on CBCR 3 and 4.
