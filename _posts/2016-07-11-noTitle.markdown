Tried to optimize PCR amplification of CBCR gblock since trial on 7/6 was incorrect. The amplification was done on CBCR2 at an annealing temp of 55, 60, and 65â„ƒ. These results were successful, leading us to believe that the issue before was with the DNA polymerase staying active through all 13 samples.
