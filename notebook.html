<p>Meeting with MARS scientist to discuss industry needs and concerns with dyes as food colorants.

The industry standard for organism-produced dyes has been Spirulina, therefore we decided to keep our workflow in Bacillus and E.

<p>Preliminary research was performed to identify non-sporulating, protease deficient, <em>Bacillus subtilis </em>strains for research use. Dr. Daniel Zeigler, from the <em>Bacillus Genetic Stock Center</em> was contacted for more information on this. Dr. Zeigler recommended the following Bacillus strains, which we ended up using for our Bacillus studies.</p>
<br />
<p><strong>B. subtilis K07 - BGSC Accession # 1A1134</strong>&ndash; Generated from the commonly used laboratory host PY79. This strain has all it's seven associated proteases knocked out and is free from antibiotic resistance or integrated plasmids. This strain does produce spores however.</p>
<br />
<p><strong>B. subtilis PY79 - BGSC Accession # 1A747 </strong><strong>-</strong> which is the wildtype strain of the K07 protease knockout. We are selecting this strain so we have a control for comparison.</p>
<br />
<p><strong>B. subtilus spo0A3 </strong>- <strong>BGSC Accession # 1S1</strong><strong> - </strong>This strain comprises spo0A mutants, therefore they do not produce alkaline or neutral proteases (most abundant). They also do not sporulate. Wall-associated proteases are still present. This strain is the result of mutations in the Spo0A locus and have normal antibiotic sensitivities. Note that Spo0A have reduced genetic competence, so it may be advisable to use electroporation to transform them.</p>

<p>Made colonies of Bacillus subtillus by placing stock colonies on LB media and glycerol stock-- allowing them to grow for multiple days.

We asked Dr. Daniel Zeigler for permission to distribute these strains and obtained written permission for this distribution on July 14th. Competence Preparation and Transformation protocols for Bacillus subtilis was also shared with the UCSC iGEM team as part of our collaboration.</p>

<p>A <em>Cryofreeze Procedure</em> was implemented as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>A single colony from Bacilus subtilis was isolated from each strain type: Spo0A3, PCY79, and KO7.</li>
<li>Single colonies were placed into a 3 ml LB media solution with no antibiotics within a test tube. This culture was grown up at 37 deg. C. at approximately 180 rpm, in a MaxQ 8000 thermal cycler.</li>
<li>A control was prepared with LB media only (no bacteria)</li>
<li>Each culture was grown up until the LB media appeared to be sufficiently cloudy.</li>
<li>Cryofreeze tubes were obtained from each culture, ensuring 2 ml total of LB-Bacillus culture and Glycerol combined made it into each Cryofreeze tube. 312.5 microliters of 80% glycerol stock was combined with 1,687.5 microliters of LB-Bacillus culture such that glycerol would comprise 12.5% of the final 2 ml solution.</li>

<p>For <em>Bacillus subtilis, </em>amplification of the following construct was performed:</p>
<p><strong>Amplification Golden Gate Reaction Part 1</strong><strong>: (pVEG @ 263 bp + RBS[AB] @ 21 bp + HO @ 720 bp + RBS[BC] @ 21bp + Pcya @ 750 bp + B0015 @ 155 bp) = </strong><strong>1,930 bp</strong></p>
<p>This segment would not amplify, contrary to gel electrophoresis results which suggested that the 1,930 base-pair construct was appropriately assembled. Something went wrong with the assembly since pVEG through B0015 would not amplify. A new route of synthesis was performed in an effort to correct this and achieve expression:</p>
<p>Amplifications of these segments were named: CAS, FBI, FDA, FOR, GEM, GRE, HAT, and SAT arbitrarily. Each name denotes the assembly technique above, such as CAS being an amplification of GG rxn 006, and FDA being an amplification of GG rxn 777, for example. The following gel was obtained:</p>
<br />
<p>Gel extractions were performed with the following: FBI, FOR, and GEM where FBI includes an amplification of the Golden Gate of the first RBS to the first terminator, and FOR/GEM includes an amplification of HO through the first terminator.</p>
<p>Effectively, the following was obtained:</p>

<p>A variety of primers were designed in order to amplify the Bacillus gene construct and in anticipation of it&rsquo;s insertion in the pHCMC04 vector. The designs were performed as follows:</p>
<p>A Golden Gate assembly was performed using the DNA amplifications of previous constructs. The assembly was performed with alternate variations of the following:</p>
<p>These sequences all came together successfully and were PCR amplified.</p>

<p><strong>Protocol from UCSC - </strong><strong><em>Bacillus subtilis </em></strong><strong>competent preparation:</strong></p>
<p>The following protocol was implemented, as shared by the UCSC iGEM team. <em>Protocol No. 4308 915.504 -</em> 08/2003</p>
<br />
<p>A solution of 0.5 M sorbitol, 0.5 M mannitol, and 10% glycerol was made. This medium serves as the <em>washing solution</em> and the <em>electroporation solution</em>.</p>
<br />
<p>Competent preparation of <em>Bacillus subtilis </em>was performed as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Overnight cultures of <em>Bacillus subtilis, </em>K07, PY79, and spo0A3 were produced with an optical density of 0.85-0.95.</li>
<li>Cells were chilled on ice-water for 10 minutes and harvested by centrifugation at 4 degrees celcius and 5000 x g for 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Cells were washed four times on ice-cold electroporation medium.</li>
<li>Cells were suspended in glycerol-LB medium for storage in the -80 degree Celcius freezer.</li>
<li>Competent cells, in theory, were thus produced.</li>
