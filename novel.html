			<h1>Novel Expression</h1>
			<p>As a result of our search for homologs to blue GAF proteins, our team selected 13 GAF domain to transform into E.coli. We were able to successfully transform 4 of them, 3 of which were blue and 1 red. </p>

			<h3>Motivation</h3>
			<p>A main focus of our project was to engineer a replacement for the dye Blue #1. While there are some known GAF proteins which absorb only ___nm away from Blue #1, this actually represents large visual differences in color. For example, the difference in color from Spriulina to Blue #1 is only 10nm, and that is clearly visible by eye (). In an effort to match Blue #1’s peak spectra better, our team chose 13 blue GAF domain homologs in an effort to expand the known blue spectra of GAF domains, and ultimately get closer to ideal absorption of 630nm (CITE). </p>
			<h3>Research</h3>
			<p>After carefully selecting our 13 GAF proteins we began their transformation into E.coli. However, this did not come without difficulties ______idk Jon______. Yada yeda.
			After persistently working through our many set backs, our team was able to transform 6 of the 13 sequences into E.coli in the following genetic circuit.  [idk Jon dis all you ]
	
			After cell lysis by sonication, the proteins were further purified using the intein mediated purification with an affinity chitin-binding tag (21). This is a purification method utilizes the inducible self-cleaving inteins to separate the protein from the affinity tag without the use of the protease (21). This purification method was chosen because it allows complete removal of the intein tag from the protein, meaning no foreign DNA is remaining on the protein after purification. Our team felt this is an important step in relation to the labeling scheme our dye may undergo in which having even a piece of non-native DNA could mean dramatic differences. A more thorough discussion of the labeling possibilities can be found here (link to HP stuff).  
			Our team discovered the purification of these proteins ultimately had a large effect on the final absorption spectra. Here you can see the difference of the absorption spectra immediately following cell lysis and after purification was performed.

			After purification the spectra of all the novel GAF domains and Blue #1 were examined for comparison. _____ conclusions based on what happens. </p>
			<h3>Future Directions</h3>
			<p>In the future, our team would like to work towards expanding the GAF domain spectra by both continuing the search for GAF homologs and also by mutations. By continuing the search for GAF homologs we feel the spectra can be significantly more filled; however, given that small changes in peak absorption visually have a significant difference in color,  we also think forcing mutations in known GAF domains is the next step. Similar to mutations performed in Roger Y. Tsien’s lab to which established that green fluorescent protein (GFP) spectral characteristics could be dramatically changed by single point mutations, our team hypothesizes that this may be the case for GAF domains as well (22). There is preliminary evidence that shows _____ () meaning that it is possible that GAF proteins spectral characteristics could be influenced by preformed intentional mutations in protein sequences. </p>
